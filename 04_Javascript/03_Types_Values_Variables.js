// Numbers:
// JavaScript represents numbers using the 64-bit floating-point format defined by the IEEE 754 standard,
// which means it can represent numbers as large as ±1.7976931348623157 × 10 308 and as small as
// ±5 × 10 −324 .
// The JavaScript number format allows you to exactly represent all integers between
// −9,007,199,254,740,992 (−2 53 ) and 9,007,199,254,740,992 (2 53 ), inclusive.
