<!-- HTML Links - Different Colors
        An HTML link is displayed in a different color depending on whether it has been visited, is unvisited, or is active.
        HTML Link Colors:
            By default, a link will appear like this (in all browsers):
                * An unvisited link is underlined and blue
                * A visited link is underlined and purple
                * An active link is underlined and red
            You can change the link state colors, by using CSS.

        Link Buttons:
            A link can also be styled as a button, by using CSS.
