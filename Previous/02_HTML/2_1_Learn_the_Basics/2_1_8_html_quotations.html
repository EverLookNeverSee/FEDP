<!-- HTML Quotation and Citation Elements:
        HTML <blockquote> for quotations:
            The HTML <blockquote> element defines a section that is quoted from another source.
            Browsers usually indent <blockquote> elements.
        HTML <q> for short quotations:
            The HTML <q> tag defines a short quotation.
            Browsers normally insert quotation marks around the quotation.
        HTML <abbr> for abbreviation:
            The HTML <abbr> tag defines an abbreviation or an acronym, like "HTML", "CSS", "Mr.", "Dr.", "ASAP", "ATM".
            Marking abbreviations can give useful information to browsers, translation systems and search-engines.
            Tip: Use the global title attribute to show the description for the abbreviation/acronym
                when you mouse over the element.
        HTML <address> for Contact Information:
            The HTML <address> tag defines the contact information for the author/owner of a document or an article.
            The contact information can be an email address, URL, physical address, phone number, social media handle, etc.
            The text in the <address> element usually renders in italic, and browsers will always add a line break
                before and after the <address> element.
        HTML <cite> for Work Title:
            The HTML <cite> tag defines the title of a creative work (e.g. a book, a poem, a song, a movie,
                a painting, a sculpture, etc.).
            Note: A person's name is not the title of a work.
            The text in the <cite> element usually renders in italic.
        HTML <bdo> for Bi-Directional Override:
            BDO stands for Bi-Directional Override.
            The HTML <bdo> tag is used to override the current text direction.
