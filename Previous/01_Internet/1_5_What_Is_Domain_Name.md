### What Is Domain Name?

A domain name is a string of text that maps to a numeric IP address, used to access a
website from client software. In plain English, a domain name is the text that a user types
into a browser window to reach a particular website. For instance, the domain name for
Google is ‘google.com’.

The actual address of a website is a complex numerical IP address (e.g. 103.21.244.0), but
thanks to DNS, users are able to enter human-friendly domain names and be routed to the
websites they are looking for. This process is known as a DNS lookup.


### Who Manages Domain Names?

Domain names are all managed by domain registries, which delegate the reservation of domain
names to registrars. Anyone who wants to create a website can register a domain name with a
registrar, and there are currently over 300 million registered domain names.


### What Is The Difference Between A Domain Name and A URL?

A uniform resource locator (URL), sometimes called a web address, contains the domain name
of a site as well as other information, including the transfer protocol and the path. For
example, in the URL ‘https://cloudflare.com/learning/’, ‘cloudflare.com’ is the domain
name, while ‘https’ is the protocol and ‘/learning/’ is the path to a specific page on the
website.
