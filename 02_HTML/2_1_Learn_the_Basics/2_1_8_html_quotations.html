<!-- HTML Quotation and Citation Elements:
        HTML <blockquote> for quotations:
            The HTML <blockquote> element defines a section that is quoted from another source.
            Browsers usually indent <blockquote> elements.
        HTML <q> for short quotations:
            The HTML <q> tag defines a short quotation.
            Browsers normally insert quotation marks around the quotation.
        HTML <abbr> for abbreviation:
            The HTML <abbr> tag defines an abbreviation or an acronym, like "HTML", "CSS", "Mr.", "Dr.", "ASAP", "ATM".
            Marking abbreviations can give useful information to browsers, translation systems and search-engines.
            Tip: Use the global title attribute to show the description for the abbreviation/acronym
                when you mouse over the element.
