<!-- HTML Attributes:
        All HTML elements can have attributes.
        Attributes provide additional information about elements.
        Attributes are always specified in the start tag.
        Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"
-->

<!-- The href attribute:
        The <a> tag defines a hyperlink. The href attribute specifies the
            URL of the page the link goes to
-->

<!-- The src attribute:
        The <img> tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page,
            The src attribute specifies the path to the image to be displayed.
        There are two ways to specify the URL in the src attribute:
            1. Absolute URL - Links to an external image that is hosted on another website.
                Example: src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/img_girl.jpg".
            Notes: External images might be under copyright. If you do not get permission to use it,
                you may be in violation of copyright laws. In addition, you cannot control external images;
                it can suddenly be removed or changed.
            2. Relative URL - Links to an image that is hosted within the website. Here, the URL does not
                include the domain name. If the URL begins without a slash, it will be relative to the
                current page. Example: src="img_girl.jpg". If the URL begins with a slash, it will be relative
                to the domain. Example: src="/images/img_girl.jpg".
        Tip: It is almost always best to use relative URLs. They will not break if you change domain.
