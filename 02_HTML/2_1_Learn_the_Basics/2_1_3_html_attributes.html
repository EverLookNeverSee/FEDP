<!-- HTML Attributes:
        All HTML elements can have attributes.
        Attributes provide additional information about elements.
        Attributes are always specified in the start tag.
        Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"
-->

<!-- The href attribute:
        The <a> tag defines a hyperlink. The href attribute specifies the
            URL of the page the link goes to
-->

<!-- The src attribute:
        The <img> tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page,
            The src attribute specifies the path to the image to be displayed.
        There are two ways to specify the URL in the src attribute:
            1. Absolute URL - Links to an external image that is hosted on another website.
                Example: src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/img_girl.jpg".
            Notes: External images might be under copyright. If you do not get permission to use it,
                you may be in violation of copyright laws. In addition, you cannot control external images;
                it can suddenly be removed or changed.
            2. Relative URL - Links to an image that is hosted within the website. Here, the URL does not
                include the domain name. If the URL begins without a slash, it will be relative to the
                current page. Example: src="img_girl.jpg". If the URL begins with a slash, it will be relative
                to the domain. Example: src="/images/img_girl.jpg".
        Tip: It is almost always best to use relative URLs. They will not break if you change domain.

<!-- The width and height attribute:
        The <img> tag should also contain the width and height attributes,
             which specifies the width and height of the image (in pixels):
                <img src="img_girl.jpg" width="500" height="600">
-->

<!-- The alt attribute:
        The required alt attribute for the <img> tag specifies an alternate text for an image, if the image for
            some reason cannot be displayed. This can be due to slow connection, or an error in the src attribute,
            or if the user uses a screen reader.
            <img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl with a jacket">
-->

<!-- The style attribute:
        The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more.
            <p style="color:red;">This is a red paragraph.</p>
-->

<!-- The lang attribute:
        You should always include the lang attribute inside the <html> tag, to declare the language of
            the Web page. This is meant to assist search engines and browsers.
