<!-- HTML Colors - HSL and HSLA
        HSL stands for hue, saturation, and lightness.
        HSLA color values are an extension of HSL with an Alpha channel (opacity).

        In HTML, a color can be specified using hue, saturation, and lightness (HSL) in the form:
            hsl(hue, saturation, lightness)
        Hue is a degree on the color wheel from 0 to 360. 0 is red, 120 is green, and 240 is blue.
        Saturation is a percentage value, 0% means a shade of gray, and 100% is the full color.
        Lightness is also a percentage value, 0% is black, and 100% is white.

        Saturation:
            Saturation can be described as the intensity of a color.
            100% is pure color, no shades of gray
            50% is 50% gray, but you can still see the color.
            0% is completely gray, you can no longer see the color.
