<!-- HTML Links:
        Links are found in nearly all web pages. Links allow users to click their way from page to page.
        HTML Links - Hyperlinks:
            HTML links are hyperlinks.
            You can click on a link and jump to another document.
            When you move the mouse over a link, the mouse arrow will turn into a little hand.
            Note: A link does not have to be texted. A link can be an image or any other HTML element!

        HTML Links - Syntax:
            The HTML <a> tag defines a hyperlink. It has the following syntax.
            The most important attribute of the <a> element is the href attribute, which indicates the link's destination.
            The link text is the part that will be visible to the reader.
            Clicking on the link text, will send the reader to the specified URL address.
            By default, links will appear as follows in all browsers:
                * An unvisited link is underlined and blue
                * A visited link is underlined and purple
                An active link is underlined and red
            Tip: Links can of course be styled with CSS, to get another look!
