<!-- HTML Basic Examples

In this chapter we will show some basic HTML examples.
Don't worry if we use tags you have not learned about yet.

HTML Documents:
    All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration: <!DOCTYPE html>.
    The HTML document itself begins with <html> and ends with </html>.
    The visible part of the HTML document is between <body> and </body>.

<!-- Example -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-GB">
<body>

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
