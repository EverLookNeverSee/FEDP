<!-- HTML Formatting:
        HTML contains several elements for defining text with a special meaning.
        HTML formatting elements:
            Formatting elements were designed to display special types of text:
                <b> - Bold text
                <strong> - Important text
                <i> - Italic text
                <em> - Emphasized text
                <mark> - Marked text
                <small> - Smaller text
                <del> - Deleted text
                <ins> - Inserted text
                <sub> - Subscript text
                <sup> - Superscript text
        The HTML <b> element defines bold text, without any extra importance.
        The HTML <strong> element defines text with strong importance. The content inside is typically
            displayed in bold.
        The HTML <i> element defines a part of text in an alternate voice or mood. The content inside is
            typically displayed in italic.
        Tip: The <i> tag is often used to indicate a technical term, a phrase from another language,
            a thought, a ship name, etc.
        The HTML <em> element defines emphasized text. The content inside is typically displayed in italic.
        Tip: A screen reader will pronounce the words in <em> with an emphasis, using verbal stress.
        The HTML <small> element defines smaller text.
        The HTML <mark> element defines text that should be marked or highlighted.
