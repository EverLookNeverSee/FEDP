### What Is Hosting?

When a hosting provider allocates space on a web server for a website to store its files,
they are hosting a website. Web hosting makes the files that comprise a website (code,
images, etc.) available for viewing online. Every website youâ€™ve ever visited is hosted on
a server.

The amount of space allocated on a server to a website depends on the type of hosting. The
main types of hosting are shared, dedicated, VPS and reseller. They are differentiated by
the kind of technology used for the server, the level of management provided and the
additional services on offer.
